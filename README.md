My inspiration for this project comes from my own experience with ADHD. The retro computer style was inspired by my father and him teaching me computers. My intentions with this project is to highlight what is like to have ADHD. A phrase I like to use when people ask me what it is like is “a computer with 100 windows open”. I took this phrase and turned it into this site. The windows that open represent my inner thoughts at all times.

Essentially, it is an HTML fork bomb that opens sites that are distracting to me. RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK.
